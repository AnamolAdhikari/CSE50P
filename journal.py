Yesterday was a productive day. I managed to complete my tasks and even had some time to relax.
I worked on my Python projects and made some good progress. I also spent time with my self as I just quit my job and I am focusing on my personal projects.
I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. I am determined to keep pushing and relearn and land a job in FAANG.

Today is a good day and I had a gret time with my girlfriend.
We watched a movie and had dinner together. I was planning on studing little bit 
but i do wanna enhjoy my weekend as well, so just commiting this file and update in github for the heat map :P

The mindset for me to just commit to this is still a win therefore I am happy about it and will not procrastinate.
I will continue to work on my projects and improve my skills in the morning tomorrow after gym. I am excited and
grateful for the progress I am making in my life.
