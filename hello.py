print ("hello, world!") # yay! first python command. 

"""
functions:

It is either action or verb that lets you do something in the program. Any language has predetermined functions.

One of the example is print() function. It prints the text inside the parentheses to the console.
In this case, it prints "hello, world!" to the console.

The next one is Arguments:

Arguments are the values you pass to a function. In this case, "hello, world!"
Simply put, arguments input to function that somehow influences its behavior.

Side Effects:
Side effects are changes that occur in the program as a result of executing a function.
In this case, the side effect is that the text "hello, world!" appears in the console.
This is a simple example of how functions, arguments, and side effects work in Python.
